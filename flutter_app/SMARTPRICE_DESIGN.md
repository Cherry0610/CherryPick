# 🎨 SmartPrice - Figma Design Implementation

## 📋 Current Status

✅ **App Name Updated**: Changed from "CherryPick" to "SmartPrice" throughout the codebase

## 🎯 What I Need from You

Since I cannot directly access your Figma design, please help me by:

### Option 1: Share Screenshots
- Take screenshots of your Figma design
- Share the key screens (Splash, Onboarding, Home, etc.)
- I'll implement the exact design

### Option 2: Describe the Design
Tell me about:
- **Colors**: What are the primary colors? (Currently using red #E53935)
- **Logo**: What does the SmartPrice logo look like?
- **Typography**: What fonts are used?
- **Layout**: How are screens structured?
- **Components**: Any specific UI components or patterns?

### Option 3: Export Design Specs
From Figma, you can:
- Export design tokens (colors, spacing, typography)
- Share component specifications
- Export assets (logos, icons, images)
